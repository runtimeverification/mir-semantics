The following test cases have either been merged into master or are currently being addressed, so they should be removed. Additionally, if any new tests added in this branch are already handled by the current semantics and there are corresponding tests in the original semantics, they should also be removed.

- closure/closure_struct_access.rs: currently being fixed with jh/deref-aggregate
