KMIR &mdash; the [K](http://github.com/kframework) semantics of [MIR (Mid-level IR of Rust)](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html)
=============================================================

üõ†Ô∏è**Work in progress**üõ†Ô∏è

KMIR defines MIR semantics formally in K and enables the scalable testing and verification of Rust smart contracts and applications.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo:  
    ```
    $ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:runtimeverification/mir-semantics.git
    ```

- Setup the environment and run the tests with either of the following options:
    - Build the docker image (`5.5.97` is a targetted K version)
    ```
    $ docker build . --build-arg K_COMMIT=5.5.97 --tag mir-semantics:5.5.97
    $ docker run --rm -it -u user -w $(pwd) -v $(pwd):$(pwd):ro mir-semantics:5.5.97 make -C kmir test-integration
    ```
    - Install K according to [K Installation Guide](https://github.com/runtimeverification/k) and other prerequisits following the [instructions](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics/tree/master/kmir).

## Test Interpretation
Running of these test cases are integrated to our CI. 
- Parsing test cases

    The folder `kmir/src/tests/integration/test-data/parsing/` contains the manually written test cases for inidividual MIR constructs and simple MIR programs.

- The `compiletest-rs` test cases

    Submodule [`compiletest-rs`](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics-compiletest/tree/9251b00e38504a6f1279b0ca9f81b90b4964080d) 
contains MIR programs emitted from `rustc`'s `ui` test cases. This test suite ensures comprehensive test coverage of MIR syntax.

- Test result interpretation

    - The `PASS` indicates a successful parsing;
    - The `SKIP` incicates a test cases failed parsing right now. (Goals for next milestone)
    - Executing these test cases should aslo return a `SKIP` result, since evaluation rules for MIR in K is not implemented yet.
